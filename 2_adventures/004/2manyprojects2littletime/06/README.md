Made it in just under the wire for day 5.

Day 5 ended up being mostly about tooling, and day 6 looks like it will be a lot more of the same.

Things I know I don't know
 - how requires work
 - how gems work
   - AFAICT this is for requiring non-core modules (or libraries or whatever ruby calls them), 
 - how to set up a minimal test
 - how to idiomatically set up a test
 - how to set up build automation
   - rakefiles
 - how to idiomatically set up a project
   - what project metadata should be included
 - how/if to do ruby functionally I still need OO concepts -- /e.g. should everything be in classes, or can I have more module-based design/
