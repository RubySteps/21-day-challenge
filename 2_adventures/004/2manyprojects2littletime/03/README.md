Background
I've committed to giving an intro talk on cryptography and cryptanalysis at a local user group in September. I've been thinking about building a toy to demonstrate the concepts in a high-level lang (ruby, python, clojure) to have a largely readable demo (in any lang other than java/c#/ObjC that everyone in the UG is too familiar with).

The Idea
I'll be using Ruby Steps to keep me honest, and do the initial impl in Ruby--forcing me to learn Ruby and letting me try out (MFE's)[https://github.com/codetojoy] War-O concept--learn a language comparatively by implementing the same simple, but not too-simple, idea idiomatically in multiple styles/languages/paradigms.

See his examples of War-O in:

 - (Groovy)[https://github.com/peidevs/WarO_Groovy]
