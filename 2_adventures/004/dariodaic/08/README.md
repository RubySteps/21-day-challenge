Exploring Set.rb class that is a part of the Ruby standard library.

It is interesting because its simple enough, and since its part of the Stdlib,
its written in Ruby. That makes it much easier to figure out what's going on
if one gets stuck.

I will use this as a material for next blitz talk in my hometown Ruby group this weekend.

Will have it ready for tomorrow.
