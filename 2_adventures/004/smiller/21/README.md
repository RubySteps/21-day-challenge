## A mini-retrospective

With [smiller/extracts](https://github.com/smiller/extracts), we’re at an interesting disconnect point.  The inner three unit tests are all working, and have driven out the `processor#citations` functionality, but what we’ve built does not also bring us most of the way to an implementation to the fourth, “outer”, unit test.  So while this was test-influenced design, it wasn’t test-driven.  Curious.
