# Well the function to create a Todoist API application is down #

While they're fixing it, I thought I would keep reading Practical Object Oriented Design in Ruby.
Then it made me want to fix some design problems in the previous todo.txt application I was building.
So I started building it as a separate project in a separate subdirectory.

I also figured I was done with my adventures in MiniSpec for now.
I like Rspec too much.
Nesting FTW.
