# Google things #

The internet is an amazing source of a lot of information.
Like a lot.
Unfortunately, no one really knows how to use it.
This little command line tool will really save you with that.

    ./google search "red pandas"

The above command will help me learn more about red pandas, even though I have never encountered one before!
Amazing!
