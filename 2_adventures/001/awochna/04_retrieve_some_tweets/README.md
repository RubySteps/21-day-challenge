# A nice little Tweeter app for day 4 #

Let's build upon the previouss tweeter command line app (tw) and make it so that it can read some recent tweets from your home timeline.
This program is heavily reliant on the 'twitter' ruby gem.

## Help ##

Create a twitter application on [Twitter's development website](https://dev.twitter.com/) and fill in the information in your own access_tokens.yml, based on access_tokens.yml.example. Then:

`./tw` for help

`./tw post "your tweet"` to post your tweet

`./tw ls` to see the last 20 tweets from people you follow
