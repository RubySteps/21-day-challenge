# Todoist API gem start #

So it turns out that the [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) format can be hard for a OOP and Regex newbie.
It's so much regex.
I do want to contribute to improving the format, there are plenty of problems I want to solve about it.
Maybe now isn't the time though.

For one thing, I actually don't use the todo.txt format in my daily life anymore.
I've switched to using [todoist](https://todoist.com) because it has all of the features I liked of todo.txt, but it flows smoother.
And, it's still great for the GTD method.
And there's the [Karma system](https://todoist.com/Help/Karma).
Go positive feedback loop!

So maybe what I can do is keep reading Sandi Metz's [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](http://wwww.poodr.com) and learn more and more about OOP and OOD.
And I can apply those principles to a gem that takes advantage of the [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/) to build out a todoist CLI.
I'll build it in my directory, instead of copying the progress from the previous day for each subdirectory.
Because, sometimes, those brilliant ideas just escape you until someone in the Gitter chat points it out.
