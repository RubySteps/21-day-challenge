# Learn about GLI #

Let's learn about GLI too, rather than just Thor.
After all, there's a [great book](https://pragprog.com/book/dccar2/build-awesome-command-line-applications-in-ruby-2) about it.
And we have that book.

The book has a cool example for a command line todo app.
We'll tweak it to match the [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) format.
