# Sometimes you just get too busy #

Deadlines come up.
You don't have time to do things you want to do.
You still want to learn about [xiki](http://xiki.org/) and [git subtrees](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt).
You still want to build something in Rails, learn about microframeworks, and automate your workflow.

You just can't _right now_.
