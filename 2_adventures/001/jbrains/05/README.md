# Day 5

I have some conflicting thoughts: handle the ant stepping off a black square, improve the format of the output, or improve the design.

I decided to go for what seems quickest, and that's improving the format of the output, both the Location and the Direction. For Location I choose the simple format "(4, -5)", but for the Direction I choose the English word for the compass direction.
