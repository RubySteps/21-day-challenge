# Day 10

I want to at least draw a grid today. After yesterday, that would make me happy.

## The Incremental Approach

This was the overall plan, in the middle of which we find ourselves.

1. Fixed viewport at the origin, simple grid of black and white squares, no representation of the ant. **WE ARE HERE**
1. Represent where the ant is.
1. Represent which way the ant is facing.
1. Movable viewport keeping the ant exactly in the middle of the screen.
1. Movable viewport keeping the ant approximately in the middle of the screen, in order to reduce viewport movement.
1. Profit?

## To Draw a Grid

Even those we're not doing TDD with automated tests, I will want to be able to build the grid incrementally. I figure I should try this:

1. Draw a 3-by-3 grid, with the origin in the center, and all squares white.
1. Color an arbitrary square black.
1. Color an arbitrary black square white again.
1. Draw a bigger (2n+1)-by-(2n+1) grid with the origin in the center.

I have one design constraint: I want the grid panel (or whatever Gtk calls it) implemented in its own module (not necessarily `module`) with as little dependency on its context as possible. In other words, I want to be able to put the grid panel wherever I want.

So... how we do draw a grid at all? Criss-crossing lines or tiling little squares? It looks like I could build it as a table, but then I wonder whether this would lead to annoying arithmetic to translate coordinates from origin-in-the-center to row-and-column-index. At least it looks like it would work at all, so there's that.

### Drawing a 3-by-3 grid as a Table

1. Draw the default table with 3 rows and 3 columns.
1. Adjust the size to make all the cells square and the same size.
1. Celebrate.

I managed to do all this, although probably quite sloppily. I need a GTK+2 sherpa to show me what pieces I have at my disposal in GTK+.

I can live with it.
