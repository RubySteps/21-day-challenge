# Instructioning is hard

Our fearless leader's README doesn't match what he did. This explains why I value examples over written instructions. Even the best get it wrong from time to time, mostly when they feel pressured to move quickly.

I created the directory `2_adventures/001/jbrains/01` to match Pat's README, rather than creating the directory `2_adventures/001/jbrains/01_day1` to match what Pat actually did, mostly because I had to pick something and I flipped a coin.

I wonder what happens next?!
