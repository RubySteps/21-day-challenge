# Day 19

I'm phoning this in, big time. Even more than yesterday. I have something like 3 minutes.

I'll refactor something. Anything.

## Reviewing The Plan

This was the overall plan, in the middle of which we find ourselves.

1. Fixed viewport at the origin, simple grid of black and white squares, no representation of the ant. **WE ARE HERE**
1. Represent where the ant is.
1. Represent which way the ant is facing.
1. Movable viewport keeping the ant exactly in the middle of the screen.
1. Movable viewport keeping the ant approximately in the middle of the screen, in order to reduce viewport movement.
1. Profit?

## The Result
