Cash Register
---

Implement Cash Register (Thai Baht) based on [Cash Register Mini Project : Learn Mocha](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-mocha)

## How its work ?

Thai Baht all coins :

```
1000 Baht - assuming is a coin
500 Baht - assuming is a coin
100 Baht - assuming is a coin
50 Baht - assuming is a coin
20 Baht - assuming is a coin
10 Baht
5 Baht
2 Baht
1 Baht

coins = [1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 2, 1]
```

### e.g:

```
totalPayable =  437
cashPaid     = 1000
dfference    =  564
change       = [500, 50, 10, 5, 2, 2, 1]
```

## What's I leared ?

- Learn TDD with MiniTest but sometimes I have no idea what's should test and don't know what I write is correct ? :)
