# Day 18

Today I'm handing in the `robot_name` exercise. The README has a paragraph about avoiding collisions for random generated values. Since the tests for this Ruby exercise don't check for these collisions I consider adding a name database beyond scope for this exercise.

Run the tests with `ruby robot_name_test.rb` and feel free to nit-pick on my solution!
