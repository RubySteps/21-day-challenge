# Day 4

Today I completed the `differences_of_squares` Exercism task.

The calculations in lines 9 and 13 are short and concise, but also a bit cryptic, especially the first one. For the difference in L17 I didn't use `abs` because the square of the sums will always be greater than the sum of the squares (mathematical proof not includedâ€¦).

Run the tests with `ruby differences_of_squares_test.rb` and feel free to nit-pick on my solution!
