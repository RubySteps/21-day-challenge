# Day 17

Right after day 16 ended I resumed working on the `roman_numerals` exercise. I was in the middle of finally getting it right, and I solved it. On one of following days I'll have to look into why I experienced weird side effects where a Ruby constant was changed when the program was run more than once.

Run the tests with `ruby roman_numerals_test.rb` and feel free to nit-pick on my solution!
