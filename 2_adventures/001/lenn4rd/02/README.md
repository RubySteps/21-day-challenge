# Day 2

A good two weeks ago, I started working on [Exercism](http://exercism.io) tasks. I picked the Ruby track because it's the language I'm most proficient in, compared to others. Still I feel there's a lot to learn for me. I planned to set aside some time every day to work on new exercises or iterate on previous ones. After the first few days I stopped, without a good reason. Whenever someone says “I didn't make it, I didn't have the time.”, I think: “Then it wasn't as important to you as other things.” Of course, that's true for me as well.

Until now I only completed the first three exercises: `hamming`, `gigasecond` and `rna-transcription`, but I iterated on them a couple of times. I was surprised that total strangers took the time to comment on my solutions and offered feedback. For a reason Exercism calls it nit-picking. I nit-picked the solutions by others, too.

So, my goal for the 21-Day Challenge is: achieve the goal I set for those exercises, to work on them each day, every day.
