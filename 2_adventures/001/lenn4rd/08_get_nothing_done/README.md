# Day 8

Today I'm annoyed with myself for missing the deadline. I'm based in Germany and the RubySteps day ends at 8pm local time. At 7pm I had finally finished my work for the day which was to write three proposals. I wanted to commit this README then and go to the gym afterwards ‚Äî but I was at the gym when I remembered this.

My idea was as follows: Although I'm officially out, I'll still participate in the daily challenge but won't open pull requests to not cause extra work for [@patmaddox](https://github.com/patmaddox). I'll join the second iteration which I'll successfully complete. üí™üèº

After coming home I read that the same happened to our RubySteps master himself. What a coincidence. Or is it?

At least the three proposals I completed today had something to do with Ruby. They're all about building or maintaining booking apps in Rails. Two of those apps already exist, one is to be created. The first one runs on Rails 2.3 (right, 2.3, not 3.2) LTS but we'll see if it makes sense to upgrade it. The second one runs on Rails 3.2 and I'd like to see it updated to the Rails 4 branch. The last one will be done in the latest 4.2, of course.
