# Day 14

I finished my slides for my talk at [Webmontag Braunschweig](http://webmbs.github.io/webmontag/), an [informal get-together](http://webmontag.de/web_montag) to share knowledge on a Monday evening. I'll talk about how to become a better developer, e.g. by solving in exercism.io tasks or participating in this 21-Day Ruby Challenge. I'll upload the slides to Slideshare and/or Lanyrd afterwards and will add a link. They're in German, though.
