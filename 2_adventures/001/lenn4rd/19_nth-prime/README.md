# Day 19

Today I began working on the `nth-prime` assignment on exercism.io. For a given position number this program outputs the prime number at that position.

The assignment states that you should implement that function yourself even if the language already includes it. I cheated and had a look at Ruby's `Prime` class. I saw that one of the ways Ruby determines the primes within a given range is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, an algorithm I had to implement in Java in my first semester at university. Should be fun!
