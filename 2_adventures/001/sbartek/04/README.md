# Proust Questionnaire

So my project is to implement a bit silly Proust Questionnaire:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proust_Questionnaire

this way everyone can compare his answers with the ones given by Proust.

At first it will work on terminal and we will try TDD using Minitest.

Today I will include a photo of class model structure in /doc
directory and yaml archive with questions and answers of Proust.
