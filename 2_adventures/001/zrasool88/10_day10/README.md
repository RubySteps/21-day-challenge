# RubySteps 21 Day Challenge. Adventure - Day 10

##About Challenge

I've been a bad boy: WROTE THIS CODE WITHOUT DOING TDD! OMG THE WORLD IS ENDING THE SKY IS FALLING KITTENS DIED.

No, but seriously, this is a small CLi app that takes a filename as an argument and backups the file in the same directory by appending .backup to the end of the filename

I wonder how else I can extend its functionality...

Also, next time: lets do this with TDD. This is just poor form on my part.

##How to use

1. Open a terminal window. Make sure you're in the project directory
2. To backup anyfile type: ruby copier.rb *filename.extension*
3. Thats it!
