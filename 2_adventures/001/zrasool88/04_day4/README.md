# RubySteps Adventure Day 4 - About Project

For day 4 of the adventure I'm not developing an app per se but a grid that is reusable across different use cases. For me that means battleship game, tic tac toe, and Conway's Game of Life. There might be other use cases but for now this is what I shall concentrate on. 

I chose this as a challenge as I found thinking about how a grid should be to confusing while trying to (and failing to) code Conway's Game of Life.

## Tools used

Ruby 2.2.1
RSpec (for TDD)

## Brainstorming

1. Grid has a user specified size
2. Grid has coordinates corresponding to the size
3. Content will be placed on Grid

## End of Adventure Thoughts

Could not complete formulating a grid. This is something i've had a problem with and I cannot figure out how to think about a grid/board etc differently. 

Hopefully next adventure I'd have submitted a completed code.
