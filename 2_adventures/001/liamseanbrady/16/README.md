### What I Learned Today

- I didn't understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism.
- I read about this topic and think I'm ready to use basic multithreading to run a countdown timer and accept user input from a CLI with `gets`, and react to each thread separately. I plan to continue with a spike at the moment to fully understand how this all works together before integrating it into an app.

Only 4 days left!
