### A Ruby App From Scratch With Tests

- I decided to add the [guard-minitest](https://github.com/guard/guard-minitest) gem early on (inspired by [kotp](https://github.com/kotp)'s Day 4 code which you can find [here](https://github.com/RubySteps/21-day-challenge/tree/master/2_adventures/001/kotp/04_automated_testing_example), in order to make testing a little quicker.
