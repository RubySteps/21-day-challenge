### What I Learned Today

- Today I played the 'Liam codes without getting stuck' game.
- This entailed 10 minute bursts of working on a program and after every 10 minutes I write a few sentences about what I did well and what my bottlenecks/sources of getting stuck were.
- It's strange to program with a goal of discovering things as opposed to reaching some end goal (a finished program). I'm sure I'll get to the finished program eventually but it's definitely out of the comfort zone to be so introspective when coding. It has been massively enlightening so far.
- This feels like Deliberate Discovery! I didn't even focus on the premise of it too much - it just sort of happened. Intentionally finding all of the things you're ignorant of is a kick in the teeth every time it happens, but it's almost guaranteed to result in gaining knowledge about *your* weaknesses, so it's an awesome kick in the teeth :)

Looking forward to continuing this process for the next 4 hours!
