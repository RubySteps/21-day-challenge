### Still Learning

- Understanding `rebase` a little more now. My Git skills are definitely on the weak side so the warmup exercises and this exercise have been useful in forcing me to move beyond basic `push`ing and `pull`ing and actually seeing the wider picture of `Git` - awesome!

- It's cool to have a goal to achieve before the end of the day. I think this will help me to be a little more goal-oriented throughout the day in general, which is always nice!
