### Refactoring Another Challenger's Code

- @r11runner's [code](https://github.com/RubySteps/21-day-challenge/blob/08cf18f0849c0bd712076d91914adbbd65bb5870/2_adventures/001/r11runner/01_day1/create_personal_directory.rb) stuck out to me and I thought it was a nice idea. I've started the process of making the original code more testable by adding simple tests (only 1 done so far).
- Doing some fairly heavy TDD with RSpec in Rails at the moment so it's a great experience to be working with plain Minitest and plain Ruby code.
- Looking forward to working on this for the next couple of days.
