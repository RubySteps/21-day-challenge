### What I Learned Today

- The RubySteps community is awesome! On Day 5 PR I got a few helpful comments and they really helped me move forward.
- Building something (non-trivial) from scratch leads to other projects/ideas.
  - In the early stages of building [Trello Rat](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/trello-rat), I decided that if I wanted to end up with something that I would actually enjoy using myself, it would help to go back to the beginning and write some user stories. This can become quite a dry, repetitive process pretty quickly, so I decided that addressing this could be a mini-project inside my Trello client project - so I started this little [User Stories Generator](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/user-stories-generator) project:
  - I am using TDD and automating the testing process with [Guard::Minitest](https://github.com/guard/guard-minitest).
  - [Pat Maddox](https://github.com/patmaddox)'s practical advice about testing really helped me to get started with writing tests this time around

    > You'd like to test that hard stuff eventually... but mostly tested code that works is better than code that doesn't work because you didn't get around to writing it ;)

- I'm really enjoying where this Trello Rat project is taking me, and enjoyment is what it's all about at the end of the day!
