### What I Learned Today

- Sandi Metz is awesome. I watched a few talks on YouTube by her last night and this morning and they were super helpful in a very practical way.
- Learning is a circular process. I'm pretty sure I had watched at least one of these Sandi Metz videos before, and understood the concepts explained by Sandi both times; but time and experience makes such a huge difference when it comes to how much you can take from a talk and actually use/reason about using in an application.
- It's becoming increasingly obvious to me that becoming a better programmer is insanely simple - build things! Learning by reading/listening/watching is great, but learning whilst also having your own things to work on is even better.

Day 11 was a very positive day!
