### What I Learned Today

Today I worked on my [User Stories Generator](https://github.com/liamseanbrady/user-stories-generator)

- It's okay to write code to make the tests pass. Once you have the tests passing, refactoring is a fun process.
- Working out the architecture of even a small app is tough. Deciding what belongs where is something that seems to come really slowly when learning to program.
- Completing a small, working utility that is helpful in your workflow doesn't take too long. My project for Day 07 and Day 08 (and probably Day 09) has only taken around 4 or 5 hours so far.
- Turning up the good and focusing on shipping (as professionally as possible) is much more fun and productive than going for perfection.
- On Day 09, I want to start working on using issues to capture things that need addressed as they arise. It's never been part of my workflow but seeing @jbrains doing it has inspired me.

**Bring on Day 09!**
