Please create your own personal subdirectory, which you'll use for the rest of the challenge.

You'll have one personal subdirectory... and then for every step of the challenge, you'll create a new sub-directory.

For example, the first day for user `patmaddox` will be under `2_adventures/001/patmaddox/01/README.md`

That means the README for day 01 for user patmaddox...

I hope that makes sense :)
