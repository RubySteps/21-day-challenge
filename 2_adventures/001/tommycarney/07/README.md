#What shall I do on day 7 of the RubySteps Adventure?
1. Experiment on creating a simple version of Reddit in rails using tutorials
as part of the "practicing rails approach"

I'm following this guide: https://github.com/schneems/reddit_on_rails/blob/master/README.md
as it's suitably high-level and slightly out-of-date, so I have to think about how to implement the steps in Rails 4 rather than just copying the code.
