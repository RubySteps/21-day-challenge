##Superhero Power creator

Randomly creates a superhero superpower from a csv I created

TO use

* add `require_relative 'suphero'` to the top of your file
* somewhere in your code call `Superhero.power` to get a random superhero power


Notes

I have a file which creates a csv given a string of superpowers I copypasta'd from the internet.
I wanted to experiment with rubys `'csv'` stuff and I thought writing and reading from a csv was a good Idea. I love the idea of creating a text file database like this.
