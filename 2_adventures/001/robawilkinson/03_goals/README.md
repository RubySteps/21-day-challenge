Too Busy today but spent time thinking of my goal for this code challenge.

I want to build a CLI tool that lets a user enter a chord name and it returns the notes that build that chord, the different fingers of that chord, and possibly how the fingerings will be. Banjo chord stuff is my MVP, guitar chords is a far off possibility
