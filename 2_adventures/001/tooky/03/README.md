# Pomodoros...

So my plan is to try and spend a pomodoro a day playing in here. So what did
I do in today's pomodoro?

## Set up script

* Truncate readme for new day rather than remove altogether.
* Commit new folder as starting point for the days work.

## TinyTest

* Created a very simple runner
* Runs a single test and records results

# Tomorrow

I want to work a bit more on TinyTest, somethings I might try:

  * Run multiple tests
  * Use the runner infrastructure to run `TinyTest`'s tests
  * Write an `assert_equal` assertion...
  * ... or something more expectationy
