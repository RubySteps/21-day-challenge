# Recording Test Failures

Wow today didn't feel like I achieved as much in a pomodoro as before... was my
test too big? Maybe testing too much? Could I have done some refactoring to make
it easier to add?

I am now recording which tests failed, along with their exception... but I don't
have a lot of information about which test failed.

I've spiked in a little report of test failures at the end, so at least as
I push on I can see more easily what's going on.

## Tomorrow

I want to give those assertions some love, even adding a message to `assert`
would help. I might have a look at building something more like hamcrest
matchers eventually. Something a bit different to minitest and rspec. Just
because :P.

## Reflection

25 minutes focused fun is good for the soul.
