# Building a test framework from scratch

What would my perfect test framework look like? Let's find out.

## Starting point

I added a very simple `assert` method. I test drove this, just by running the
file. I've tried to document the steps using the git commit messages.

I've wrapped the tests for assert in lamdas - mostly so I can give them names
using the variable names.

## Tomorrow

I want to run tests and get results. I'm not sure if its too big a step to move
these tests into something like that now. So maybe I'll start work on that and
refactor these tests later. Maybe a sign that starting with assert wasn't needed
:)
