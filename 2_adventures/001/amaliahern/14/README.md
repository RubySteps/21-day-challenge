DAY 14 
Second kata at CodeKata: karate chop
Write a binary chop method that takes a integer search target and a sorted array of integers. It should return the integer index of the target in the array , or -1 if the target is not in the array.

I will use the test that the author suggested me at codekata page. Go, go, go!!
