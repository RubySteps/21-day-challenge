DAY 6 
I tried the refactor on fizzBuzz kata that kopt suggested me: removed the unnecessary line where it tested if number is divisible by 3 and 5, used shovel operator to do a concat() on the final result.
I have problems about the test for 3 and 5, it didn't write "fizzbuzz" Why did it only probe one case, the reason is the elsif?

Tomorrow I will test again.
