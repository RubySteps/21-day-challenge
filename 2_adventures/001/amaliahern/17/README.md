DAY 17
I started Weather Data of Code Kata.
Below I write the steps I should develop:
1) Open the file because exits
2) Convert file in an array
3) Clean the array, removing the two first lines (header and space line)
4)Map and I can convert it in a arrays inside in a array
5) Only I need the third first component of every array
6) I can write them as integer component
7) I evaluate which is the less temperature and write the day number
          need temporal variable to save the minimum value 
          swap currently value of temporal variable if I can find another minimum value
