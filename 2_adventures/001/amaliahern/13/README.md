DAY 13
Today I tried to start CodeKata, I choosed  the first on, Supermarket pricing.
"Because experience is the only teacher"

the kata involves no coding. 

I should answer these questions:
does fractional money exists? Yes, it is. There are cents, so there are fractional money.
when if ever does rounding take place? when the money doesn´t reach the unit. For example, the simple price is, 1.99 € 
The fractional part is 0.99 € 

how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
