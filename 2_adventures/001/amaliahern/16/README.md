DAY 16
I started kata number 4 of Code Kata: Data Munging 
Part one: weather Data
Write a program to output the day number (column one in file of data) with the smallest temperature spread. The maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum is the thrid column.

So, my task:
1- download the data
2- open file
3- read file 
4- think how to save the weather data: map, hash ?Â¿
5- write a minimun value and swap it when you find another smaller
5- out should be the number of the day with minumum value (9 looking at the weather data)
