DAY 5
I am going to try the refactor on fizzBuzz kata that kopt suggested me:
"if you chose not to return (yet) you can build your result and return when you are done. This way you only have to check for each/all states one time.
Consider the case where you end up playing this game with 3 primes or 4 or 5? How long will this one line get?"
