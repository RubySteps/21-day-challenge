DAY 8
(Hard day) 
Discovering fizzbuzzazzkezz repository of Victor, "When fizzbuzz is not enough" Nice!
I donÂ´t understand: 

In line 16: is it the same use "+=" than "<<" (shovel operator)
In line 16: where is modulo function? 
In line 21: result * "\n" what does asterisc mean?

Thank you so much for your code :-)
