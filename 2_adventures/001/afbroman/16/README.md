## RubySteps 21-Day Challenge: Day 16

Today I’m revisiting Day 11’s maze code (from Jamis Buck’s book, _Mazes for Programmers_).

I’m using TDD via RSpec this time. It was a great experience, since I realized I rarely work on plain Ruby projects (i.e., non-Rails), and I had to stumble quite a bit before figuring out how to get it all set up.
