## RubySteps 21-Day Challenge: Day 11

I’ve been playing with the code from Jamis Buck’s new book from Pragmatic Bookshelf, [Mazes for Programmers](https://pragprog.com/book/jbmaze/mazes-for-programmers). It’s quite a fun book and digs pretty deeply into maze-related algorithms, using Ruby as the language.

I’m not very far into it, but I’m getting rather hooked.
