## RubySteps 21-Day Challenge: Day 5

Have some deadlines this evening, so I’m not adding any code today.

### Some plans for upcoming days
* I’m taking [Jafar Husain’s Async JS course](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/async-javascript/) this weekend, so [RxJS](http://reactive-extensions.github.io/RxJS/) code is
likely.
* I need to work more seriously on some React.js code.
* I’ve been working with Jamis Buck’s new book _[Mazes for Programmers]_. It’s great fun, and all in Ruby. I’d like to get more serious about digging into its code.
