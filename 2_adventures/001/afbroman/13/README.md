## RubySteps 21-Day Challenge: Day 13

I have created a frightfully messy class that pulls data from a database and a CSV file, munges it, and outputs it into a new CSV file.

All this to create an interactive data visualization, which is not yet created.

This is embarrassing code, and it’s exhibiting my very bad “copy it from the REPL” habit. I tend to do this in both Ruby and R when I’m running close to deadlines, and it leads to painful technical debt.

Incidentally, this requires the `database_connect.rb` file from Day 10, as well as a `database.yml` file (and a database full of opioid data).
