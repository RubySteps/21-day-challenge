## RubySteps 21-Day Challenge: Day 4

### Simplistic Rails-React app

I’m working on learning [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
with the help of [Arkency’s](https://twitter.com/arkency) new book,
_[Rails Meets React.js](http://blog.arkency.com/2015/04/rails-meets-react-dot-js-is-out-what-you-can-find-inside/)_.


I’m cramming my brain with React.js knowledge because I hope to use it
on a scientific application that will have an extremely complicated UI
(i.e., very nested forms).

Ruby version: 2.2.2
Rails version: 4.2.1
react-rails version: 0.13.0
