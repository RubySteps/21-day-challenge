## RubySteps 21-Day Challenge: Day 14

From the code I was working on yesterday (or, more precisely, from the CSV output from that code), I have made a first pass at a static D3.js plot.

There are obviously some problems with it:

1. The lines are meant to be the same colors as their labels. I’m not sure yet why this isn’t happening.
2. Two labels are completely overlapping. This will probably have to be a special-case fix.
