## RubySteps 21-Day Challenge: Day 6

I’m taking [Jafar Husain](https://twitter.com/jhusain)’s [Async JS course](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/async-javascript/) this weekend,
so I’m using a small sample of what we’re working on. Today, that’s mostly been implementing functional programming tools using some ES6 syntax.
