Back to work...
* a little more fallout from last weeks outage :(
* lots of email distractions - work related
* also last minute bike ride organising for next weekend... cant wait to get to it
* a little progress on the functional test for FIX component - it runs and connects - now to push data through it!
* 16 mile bike ride - was hoping for 20, but my shortcut was unusually a real shortcut!
