Working on the weekend? This must be open source!

* last night I progressed the prod release prep - kicked off the automated tests, triggered the prod build/test run
* Also fixed the DEV server for the side project, db/code was out of sync. Handed it over for testing
* Today took the bicycle in for a service - in prep for the big cycle ride in 2 weeks time! (150 miles...)
* Usual Saturday type stuff shopping/haircut/BGT
* Catch up on some 'tech reading', things like http://rubyweekly.com/
