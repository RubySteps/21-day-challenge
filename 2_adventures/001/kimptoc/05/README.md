Day 5

* lots of problems with testing today, had to go back a few steps/stay late - hopefully fixed now
* meeting about the charity cycle ride in 2 weeks - 150miles... decided to start an hour earlier...
* looked at a few other repos, looks like people are really doing some coding, nice!
* no code at all today :(
