Continuing to work on the 3 accounts from yesterday.  
I've placed the 3 accounts.
Version 2 deposits same amount into each account. 

Added an array for 3 deposit amounts
Version 3 deposits all 3 amounts into each account.  Still trying to figure how to create the 'amt' array from a single input.

Version 4 uses the zip method to input the amounts into the accounts. creates a hash, but doesn't add the amount apparently.
