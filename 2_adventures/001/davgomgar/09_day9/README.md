Day 9 README

- For now, I've decided to implement a simple kata with Ruby implementing some
tests with RSpec  and following TDD methodology.

- Chosen editor to implement this is VIM (I really want to learn VIM, and I'm
  well aware it's not an easy task :D)

- The Kata to implement is the [String Calculator
  kata](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)
