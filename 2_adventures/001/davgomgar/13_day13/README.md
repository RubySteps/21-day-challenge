Day 13 README
===

- For now, I've decided to implement a simple kata with Ruby implementing some
tests with RSpec  and following TDD methodology.

- I've decided to implement this kata using VIM (I know VIM has a steep
  learning curve)

- The Kata to implement is the [String Calculator
  kata](http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/)

- Tests were refactored today
