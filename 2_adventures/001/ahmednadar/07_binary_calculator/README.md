## Description:

I need to write a function that will receive two strings (n1 and n2), each representing an integer as a binary number. A third parameter will be provided (operation) as a string representing one of the following operators: **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**.

The task is to write the calculate function so that it will perform the arithmetic and the result returned should be a string representing the binary result.

Examples:
```ruby
  1 + 1 === 10
  10 + 10 === 100
```

Negative binary numbers are usually preceded by several 1's. For this kata, negative numbers can be represented with the negative symbol at the beginning of the string.

Examples of negatives:

```ruby
	1 - 10 === -1
	10 - 100 === -10
```
## Thoughts...

Algorithms are sometimes hard for me, but it's very interesting to work on them.  
At the beginning I had no idea how how to go about it or even fully understand it.  
Searching online and reading the description many times, cleared some aspects.  
I should do more Algorithms katas or quizzesÂ·
