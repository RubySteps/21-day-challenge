# Adventure Day 4

Just what is cool about a Dragonfly?

* The young and the adult both feed on the respective ages of
the mosquito! Dragonfly larvae eat mosquito larvae. Adult
dragonflies eat mosquitos. Long live draginflies!
* The rough leading edge of the dragonfly wing "trips the
boundary layer turbulent!" Huh? Yea, instead of smooth laminar
flow, the efficiency is improved with turbulent flow. The dimples
  on the golf ball serve the same purpose, allowing much
  greater distance in flight!
