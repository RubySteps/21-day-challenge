Victor's innocent comment about

    def initialize(opts={})
      @host            = opts[:host]
      ...
    end

Victor queried:

    For more current versions of Ruby this is
    no longer necessary. But I think the question
    then becomes "What exactly can I pass in that are named?"

That sent me on some research...
