# Adventure Day 2

Well, day one was sort of adventurous in the land of misfit Pull Requests...
And I learned that I can `rebase my GitHub fork` which pulls in the latest and greatest from the patmaddox repo :-)
    And totally screws you over big time, with all sortf of commits that really aren't yours.
    DO NOT DO THIS!
