Day 16 challenge

OK, so it looks like my internet is back on line.

YAY!!

and finally.

So now I need to try and get some momentum back. Monster headache is not helping.

I updated a document where I've been making notes about my learning from using the command line in terminal and copied it into today's folder. Today was seeing what happened when I merged all the GitHhub changes I made in Github's web interface with my local PC git which has been offline since about day 6.

It worked, no merge conflicts, so that was good. Mind you, there wasn't anything complex about what I was doing, so it should have been straightforward.

So I suppose now the challenge is to work out what next.

That's it, I'll push these changes to Github and submit a pull request for Day 16.
