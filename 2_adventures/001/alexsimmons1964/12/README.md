Well it looks as though I'm still in the challenge.

My ISP online faults service said my connection was back. Yay! I thought, so I returned home.
Of course once I got home I discovered that the internet was still down and a new fault notification
had been posted. Not expected to be connected until Tuesday night my time. A week and a half without
connection.

Ugh.
