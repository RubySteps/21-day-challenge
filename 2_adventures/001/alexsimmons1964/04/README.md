Decided to add my thoughts from yesterday since all I can do at present is write text.
Coding - I've no idea where to start!

Warmup Exercise
It took forever to get through the warm up exercise. Well 2 days seemed like forever to 
simply add a text file to a folder. lol

@kotp was very generous with his time taking me through a lot of things but inside 
unfamiliar terrain of an online terminal emulator. Bit like learning a foreign language 
while also learning to juggle while riding a bike on a trampoline.

My Day Job
In between this stuff and my regular coaching work, I've programmed a velodrome timing system
using stopwatch software integrated with Excel and Excel VB. It uses a ribbon tape switch on 
the track to trigger the lap timing and with full screen numbers for rider display. Will be 
very useful for our next batch of world record attempts and championships training. Would be
uber cool to take this little project further - a deployable portable track timing system.

I have so many things I'd love to be able to create with software, but sadly I'm lacking the
knowledge. I've got some cool stuff done with Excel VBA but need to make things more
universally usable. So many ideas...


Git seems rather confusing with all the various copies/clones/branches etc.

I eventually managed to clone the 21-day-challenge repo onto my own github and to my local 
PC where I make my changes and have managed to push those up to git hub and send a pull 
request via the browser interface.

I added some very basic README.md files into the appropriate folders, with exception of day 3
where I simply placed a blank .gitkeep file after a suggestion by someone on Gitter. I started
the whole challenge a day or so behind, so it was all catch up stuff for me.

My navigation skills in terminal (I am using Windows Powershell) are rudimentary, and at
one point found myself in a terminal text editor with no idea how I got there, why I got
there, nor how to get out! Bizarre. Gitter to the rescue.

Pull Requests

I'm unclear on the pull requests, what they mean, do, or whether I'm doing them right. Some
of my files are appearing on the main repo so I'm guessing it worked but I don't know why.

Team was trying to explain them last night to me on Gitter and I have a bit of a better idea 
but much of it is still a mysterious black box.

I went through the suggested git octocat tutorial but it just gets you to type stuff in and 
it glosses over what's going on and more importantly why.

I find the git "grammar" inconsistent/confusing. Sometimes a dash, sometimes two dashes, 
sometimes a space, sometimes no space, sometimes single quote, other times double quotes, 
sometimes full words, sometimes contractions, sometimes single letters. Sometimes no letters 
but dots. Sometimes capitals, other times lower case. All these subtle variations make little 
sense to me and the significance of these variations is not explained.

I'm confused on branches as well. I've been pushing local changes to my github master but it 
was suggested this was the wrong thing to do, after someone said it was right thing to do.

The git tutorial assumes you know what a branch was and why you have one. I get the 
basic idea that you want a place to try things out and not spoil original code in case you 
fuck up, but after that I don't quite follow what going on, nor how to use one, or whether I
should.

Much more learning to be done. I have to do my normal work now...
