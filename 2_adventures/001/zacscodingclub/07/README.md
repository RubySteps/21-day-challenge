Day 7:
-Using CLI to create directories and files (including this one.)
-Also including the start of a side project
	-The goal for this project will be to do three specific things:
			1) Read and save all html from several URIs
			2) Process the html to extract the relevant info needed (Gym Name, Address, Contact Info, etc.)
			3) Loop through that info and display it on a map (Google maps, maybe OpenLayers) for a better user experience than the current map (http://www.teamusa.org/usa-weightlifting/clubs-lwc/find-a-club)
