So I've been looking at how to code in an iPad, and here's what I found out:

* [koder app](http://www.koderapp.com/) offers a nice text editor with syntax highlighting for lots of languages, including Haskell and Ruby :)
* [nitrous.io](https://www.nitrous.io/) offers development boxes on the cloud
* [this tutorial](http://blog.icodelabs.net/2014/08/how-to-connect-to-nitrous-io-with-koder-app/) apparently shows how to merge the two.

The alternative -- DietCoda -- looks awesome, but it looks excessively focused on the web.

I was going to do a random code snippet but my brain appears to be in deadlock today.
