# Adventure 10_day10: scope

Yesterday I read about scopes in ActiveRecord, and I thought that this would be a meaningful refactoring also in my application fibo-flash-cards: https://github.com/r11runner/fibo-flash-cards
(It doesn't use ActiveRecord, but mongoid. But scopes still seem to work well.)
