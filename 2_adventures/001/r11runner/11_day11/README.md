## Rails form helper to replace some custom markup

Today, I was working on a Rails-app to store chess games and notes, so I decided to copy a snippet from its code to my challange directory.

WikiTextHelper.replace_custom_markup
    # at the moment 2 custom markups are supported:
    # #game<id>#link# => a link to the game
    # #game<id>#board# => an iframe with a pgn4web-board displaying the pgn-text of the game
