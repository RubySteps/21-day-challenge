#Day 3
Today I continue to solve my little day-to-day problems programmatically.

So instead of using legwork to tick of my tasks I try to program little tools that make my job easier, or improve workflow.

##Today's challenge - Google SNAFU
This is one of the issues that requires a quick response:

Some documents, that shouldn't be out in the open have appeared in the google index. And also quite a lot of them. Too much, in fact, to copy each file out of the google result screen

"Ruby to the Rescue!"

Unfortunately the Google API only yields max. 64 results and I couldn't find a way around that. Maybe I'll improve on that tomorrow!
