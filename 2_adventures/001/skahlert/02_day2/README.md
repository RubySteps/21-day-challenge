#Day 2
Okay, so I see in the other pull requests, that we have to come up with our own solutions? Great... that's gonna be tough, I guess.

So I'll try to add the various little problems I face every day. I'll try to abstract them and remove references to the RoR or fancy gems if possible. But that's gonna be tough!

## Todays challenge
Just had the problem that I had to import taxonomy information from an excel spreadsheet.
As usual with manually entered date, there are little mistakes.
Most of those mistakes included upper/lower-case and punctuation issues.

To reduce the amount of those mistakes I coded that small and convenient conversion method.

Of course there are nicer ways to do that with ActiveRecord!
