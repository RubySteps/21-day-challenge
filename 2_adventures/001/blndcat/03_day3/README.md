# Day 3

So here are roughly the katas I've decided to do

* The Hello World of TDD/BDD with RSpec but maybe MiniTest
* Git rebase I
* Git rebase II
* set-up a vagrant box
* clone my dotfiles into vagrant box/cloud
* Hello World rails app to dokku

I might just loop round them 3 times or I might come up with a few more

## Things I have learnt so far
* using github in the fork/PR model
* adding a ssh key to github
* git rebase to sync changes from original fork

I really liked the retrospective of Day 2. Timezones are a bit of a problem though
