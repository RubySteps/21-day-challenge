# Day 2

So let me start by saying, if you are not on the gitter channel, you'll probably be quite lost.  

Have read the messages from Pat on gitter and realising that we'll have to come up with our own programming challenges, I was initially disappointed.  

I guess I get his thinking, the whole habit forming process and so on but still it felt like turning up to a D&D game where the DM said "Do your own thing"

Anyway, since I was caught unprepared and the bare minimum is a README I'll just submit this.  However between now and Day 3, I'll have a think about some challenges in the form of some simple katas.  

"Now the fun begins..."
