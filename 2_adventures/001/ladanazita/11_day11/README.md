# Hamming

Writing a program that can calculate the Hamming difference between two DNA strands.

Method needs to calculate the difference between two strands of equal length. Returns number of differences between the two strands.

Getting syntax errors on my tests, stating that there is an unexpected end of input. Any feedback is appreciated!
