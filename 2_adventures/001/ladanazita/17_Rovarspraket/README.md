#Rövarspråket

*Taken from reddit/r/dailyprogrammer*

Method creates a SUPER-SECRET Swedish language  known as "Rövarspråket" (which means "Robber's language", more or less).

Rövarspråket is not very complicated: you take an ordinary word and replace the consonants with the consonant doubled and with an "o" in between. 

So the consonant "b" is replaced by "bob", "r" is replaced with "ror", "s" is replaced with "sos", and so on. Vowels are left intact. It's made for Swedish, but it works just as well in English.

Objective is to write a program that can encode a string of text into Rövarspråket.

**Input**

Jag talar Rövarspråket!
