#Multiply 
Playing with syntax to understand how to repeat a character. Method takes a numerical input and returns the string 'hue' as many time as inputted. Running into errors when utilizing the .times method; this method returns the string as many times as indicated, but also includes the number inputted. Found a solution around this by utilizing 'hue'*number.
