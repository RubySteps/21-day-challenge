# Pair Programming Monday!

Spent 3 hours pair programming today, covered a wide variety of technologies.

Spent some time rebasing commits.  The workflow for the challenge means that we
simply shouldn't merge our branches to master.  Let them get merged in via pull
requests and then pull from upstream, or merge them into your master.  But not
both.
