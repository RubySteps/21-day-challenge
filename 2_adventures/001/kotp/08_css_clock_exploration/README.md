# Clock in CSS3

I saw this and thought I would play with it a little bit.

Can I make it a 24 hour analog clock?  Can it be useful for the RSST Clock?

Challenges I see are providing a dynamic time, as CSS does not have a
functionality to do this as far as I know.  Of course, this code is from 2012,
perhaps there is now a mechanism for this now.

Definitely an unfamiliar territory for me.
