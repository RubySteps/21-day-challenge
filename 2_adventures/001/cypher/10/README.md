# The one where I attend a freelancing group

... in part to do a very short talk about mastermind groups.

Thing is, I'm in one, but quickly discovered that (a) they suprisingly don't do your work for you ;) and
(b) it is kind of like being in a relationship - you only really get to know them after you've joined them
for a while.
