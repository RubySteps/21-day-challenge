# What happened to the server?

Turns out, the usual "have you tried turning it off and on again?" did not work this time. The
really nice datacenter staff turned it off, but the server didn't come up again &mdash; turns out
one of the hard drives was broken. Thank god for RAID-1 :)

Let's just hope the other hard drive continues to work until tomorrow, when a replacement drive can be installed.

# The one with the going freelance

Due to reasons laregly outside my control, the company I work for has decided to move to another country.
Which means I'll loose my job fairly soon. On the upside, they've asked me to stay on as a freelancer
to maintain & keep on developing the existing system. Now I'm investigating all the legal intricacies on
how to create a business where I live & the costs involved.

I always wanted to become independent, but that's not how I imagined it to go ;)
