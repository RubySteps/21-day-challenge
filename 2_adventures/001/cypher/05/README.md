# The story for today

Didn't get much done today in terms of coding or anything tech/business-related, but on the other hand I slept in,
had a nice breakfast with my girlfriend, went shopping with her, bought a few new interesting beers (including one
that contains caffeine, called Eule ("Owl")), and cleaned the flat.
