# Monads

Yesterday, I wrote about learning Rust. Today, I watched a video called
[Refactoring Ruby with Monads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTR__8RvgvM) by Tom Stuart, and it's opened my eyes on
how Monads actually work. They're actually pretty simple!

## Rust

But back to what I actually wanted to learn: Rust. Now that I've seen how Monads work, I've thought that
I could try and implement a few of them in Rust. So tomorrow, there might actually be some code!

Maybe.



Not promising anything ;)
