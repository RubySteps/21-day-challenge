# ROSSConf!

Today I'm at [ROSSConf, the Ruby Open Source Software Conference](http://www.rossconf.io) in Vienna.

Piotr talked about why he started to work on reek, a Ruby source code smell detector. Turns out, he really likes keyword
arguments, and that was how he got his first code into reek. Now he helps to maintain and improve the project.

## [Michal Papis](https://twitter.com/mpapis) on rvm

Michal Papis is the current maintainer of rvm. One interesting point he made is that he used to fix all the bugs and
issues users reported, which meant no one else ever had any chance to work on it. So now he takes more of a
backseat advisory role when people report issues, so they can work on rvm themselves.

## [Lisa Passig](https://github.com/lislis) on \*Diaspora

She described on she initially got involved with Diaspora, and why the project is important in general. She also
showed how the community took over development and project management after the original dev team dropped out.
