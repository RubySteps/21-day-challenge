# Thoughts on customer support

I don't have direct contact with the customers of my company. On some level, I'm glad about that (the stories the
customer care people tell me are only amusing because they haven't happened to me), but on the other hand, it's a
bit sad, because I'm in a unique position to actually do something about their problems, at least once the usual
customer care procedures can't help any more.

But in a way, I actually do customer care. It's just that my customers are the customer care people (amonst others,
obviously). And today was filled solving problems they had, wether it was something they relayed from the end customers
to me, or some other problem that they had they needed solved. So, I didn't get much 'work' work done, but I did make
some of my colleagues lives a tiny, tiny amount better.
