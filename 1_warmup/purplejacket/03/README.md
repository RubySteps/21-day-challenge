One area that I would like to start investigating is controller testing, and beyond that, controller design.

I took Wolf Arnold's excellent "Efficient Rails Test Driven Development" course back in 2010.  There were six sessions and professionaly produced videos were created.  Here are two relevant ones in particular:

#4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8FS5P6i3Wc

I have also discovered a number of links on writing controller tests:

https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-rails/docs/controller-specs
http://everydayrails.com/2012/04/07/testing-series-rspec-controllers.html
http://solnic.eu/2012/02/02/yes-you-should-write-controller-tests.html
http://codecrate.com/2014/11/rspec-controllers-best-practices.html
https://robots.thoughtbot.com/how-we-test-rails-applications
https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/How-To:-Test-controllers-with-Rails-3-and-4-(and-RSpec)

It is my goal to create some code examples that exercise these practices.
