# 01 Warm Up

## Commit #1

After forking the project, get a copy of the "clone URL" from github

    `cd ~`
    `mkdir rubysteps`
    `cd rubysteps`
    `git clone <paste your URL>`
    `cd 21-day-challenge`

I then created a new feature branch

    `git checkout -b jk-warmup-1`

I created this file/folder that you are reading
I committed the work

    `git add .`

I pushed to remote

    `git push origin jk-warmup-1`

Then I went to my github account, on the forked version of 21-day-challenge:

* saw my new topic branch `jk-warmup-1` along with `master`.
* So I clicked the `pull requests` icon, which told me I had none.
* Then I clicked `create a pull request`
* I chose my topic branch to compare against master and, finally,
* I clicked `create pull request`

Wow, is collaboration really this hard? I bet I am doing something wrong.

Normally I have used Reenhanced's git reflow gem to make this magically not so hard.
