# 02 Warm Up

## Commit #2

* I created a new feature branch

    `jk-warmup-2`

* I created this file/folder by cut/paste in Rubymine cuz I'm lazy like that
* I added an awesome ruby file because I saw others do that
* I committed the work
* I pushed to remote

    `git push origin jk-warmup-2`

* Then I went to my github account, on the forked version of 21-day-challenge
* saw my new topic branch
* clicked the `pull requests` icon
* which told me I had none, so i clicked `create a pull request`
* then I chose my topic branch to compare against master
* and I clicked `create pull request`
