Steps that got me here... first I forked the project, and then:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:luisalima/21-day-challenge.git
git checkout -b warmup.luisalima
cd 21-day-challenge/1_warmup
mkdir -p luisalima/01
cd luisalima/01
emacs README.md # emacs rocks!
# edit README.md...
```

... and now I'll make two commits.
