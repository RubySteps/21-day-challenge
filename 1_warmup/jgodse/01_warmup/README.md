# The first warmup

I 

I forked and cloned the git repo at  [https://github.com/RubySteps/21-day-challenge](https://github.com/RubySteps/21-day-challenge/), which appear to be a test of my ability to create a pull request.

## What I Did

* I created a directory under 1_warmup called 1_warmup/jgodse/01_warmup, and a file in it called README.md (this one)
* Wrote this document in order to demonstrate that I can submit an acceptable pull request.
*
* I plan to commit locally, then push to GitHub, then issue a pull reqvest.
