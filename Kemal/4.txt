Day 4

"People do not follow uncommitted leaders. Commitment can be displayed in a full range of matters to include the work hours you choose to maintain, how you work to improve your abilities, or what you do for your fellow workers at personal sacrifice."
â€” Stephen Gregg
Chairman and CEO of Ethix Corp.
